# Contributing

Contributions to Ringo are very welcome.

For questions, feature requests, and bug reports please post on the [GitHub](https://github.com/racehub/om-bootstrap/issues), with appropriate labels.

Contributions are preferred as GitHub pull requests on branches. Please send pull requests to the `develop` branch. All new work is based off of `develop`; release are cut by merging `develop` into `master` and generating a release tag.

Before submitting a pull request, I ask that you:

- Follow the conventions in the existing code, including standard Clojure indentation, no trailing whitespace, and
  a max width of 95 columns
- Show empathy to new Clojure/Clojurescript developers
- Consider "best practices" towards building a better Ring/Om ecosystem

Thank you for helping new Clojure engineers and designers, like myself, call Clojure/Clojurescript our _home_.
